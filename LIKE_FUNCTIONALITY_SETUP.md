# Like Functionality Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the like functionality in your SecondChance matrimony application.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The like functionality allows users to:
- **Like profiles** they're interested in
- **See liked profiles** in their matches page
- **Get notifications** when someone likes them
- **Create mutual matches** when both users like each other
- **View button state changes** (Like â†’ Liked with green color)

## ðŸ“‹ Required Firebase Collections

The like system requires these Firebase Firestore collections:

### 1. `likes` Collection
Stores all like interactions between users.

**Document Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated-id",
  likerId: "user-who-liked-id",
  likedId: "user-who-was-liked-id", 
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

### 2. `matches` Collection
Stores mutual matches when both users like each other.

**Document Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated-id",
  user1Id: "first-user-id",
  user2Id: "second-user-id",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp,
  status: "active" // active, archived, etc.
}
```

### 3. `notifications` Collection
Stores notifications for likes and matches.

**Document Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated-id",
  userId: "user-who-receives-notification-id",
  type: "like", // like, match, message, etc.
  data: {
    likerId: "user-who-liked-id",
    likerName: "John Doe",
    likerProfileImage: "https://example.com/image.jpg"
  },
  read: false,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script

1. **Update Firebase Config**: Edit `setup-like-collections.js` and replace the Firebase config with your actual project details.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Firebase SDK installed:
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```

3. **Run Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   node setup-like-collections.js
   ```

### Step 2: Create Firestore Indexes

Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Indexes tab and create these indexes:

#### Likes Collection Indexes:
- `likerId` (Ascending)
- `likedId` (Ascending) 
- `createdAt` (Descending)
- `likerId` (Ascending) + `createdAt` (Descending)
- `likedId` (Ascending) + `createdAt` (Descending)

#### Matches Collection Indexes:
- `user1Id` (Ascending)
- `user2Id` (Ascending)
- `createdAt` (Descending)
- `user1Id` (Ascending) + `createdAt` (Descending)
- `user2Id` (Ascending) + `createdAt` (Descending)

#### Notifications Collection Indexes:
- `userId` (Ascending)
- `type` (Ascending)
- `read` (Ascending)
- `createdAt` (Descending)
- `userId` (Ascending) + `read` (Ascending)
- `userId` (Ascending) + `createdAt` (Descending)
- `userId` (Ascending) + `type` (Ascending) + `createdAt` (Descending)

### Step 3: Update Security Rules

In Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Rules, update your security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Likes collection
    match /likes/{likeId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.likerId == request.auth.uid || 
         resource.data.likedId == request.auth.uid);
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.resource.data.likerId == request.auth.uid;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.likerId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Matches collection
    match /matches/{matchId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.user1Id == request.auth.uid || 
         resource.data.user2Id == request.auth.uid);
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.resource.data.user1Id == request.auth.uid || 
         request.resource.data.user2Id == request.auth.uid);
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.user1Id == request.auth.uid || 
         resource.data.user2Id == request.auth.uid);
    }
    
    // Notifications collection
    match /notifications/{notificationId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Registrations collection (for profile data)
    match /registrations/{registrationId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Functionality

### Step 1: Run Test Script

1. **Update Firebase Config**: Edit `test-like-functionality.js` with your Firebase config.

2. **Run Test**:
   ```bash
   node test-like-functionality.js
   ```

This will:
- Create test likes between users
- Verify like checking functionality
- Test mutual match detection
- Show button state simulations

### Step 2: Manual Testing

1. **Like a Profile**: Go to `/profiles` and click "Like" on a profile
2. **Check Button State**: The button should change to "Liked" with green color
3. **Check Matches Page**: Go to `/matches` and see the liked profile in "You Liked Profiles" tab
4. **Test Mutual Match**: If the other user also likes you, it should appear in "Your Matches" tab

## ðŸŽ¨ How It Works

### Like Button States

The like button has these states:

1. **Loading**: Shows "Loading..." while checking if already liked
2. **Like**: Blue button with "Like" text (not liked yet)
3. **Liking**: Shows "Liking..." while processing the like
4. **Liked**: Green button with "Liked" text and filled heart icon

### Like Flow

1. **User clicks "Like"** on a profile card
2. **System checks** if user already liked this profile
3. **Creates like record** in `likes` collection
4. **Sends notification** to the liked user
5. **Checks for mutual like** and creates match if both users like each other
6. **Updates UI** to show "Liked" state
7. **Refreshes matches page** to show the liked profile

### Match Detection

When User A likes User B:
1. System checks if User B has already liked User A
2. If yes, creates a match record in `matches` collection
3. Sends match notifications to both users
4. Shows match in "Your Matches" tab (Premium feature)

## ðŸ“± User Experience

### Free Users
- Can like profiles
- Can view profiles they've liked in "You Liked Profiles" tab
- Cannot view mutual matches (Premium feature)

### Premium Users  
- All free features
- Can view mutual matches in "Your Matches" tab
- Priority profile visibility

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Button not changing to "Liked"**:
   - Check if Firebase collections are created
   - Verify security rules allow read/write
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Liked profiles not showing in matches**:
   - Verify `getLikedProfiles` function is working
   - Check if user is authenticated
   - Ensure proper data structure in collections

3. **Notifications not working**:
   - Check notifications collection exists
   - Verify notification creation in Firebase functions
   - Check security rules for notifications

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Firebase Console**: Look for errors in Firestore logs
2. **Browser Console**: Check for JavaScript errors
3. **Network Tab**: Verify API calls are successful
4. **Test Script**: Run `test-like-functionality.js` to verify setup

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the test script output** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify Firebase configuration** is correct
3. **Ensure all collections and indexes** are created
4. **Check security rules** are properly configured

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

You'll know the like functionality is working when:

âœ… Like button changes from blue "Like" to green "Liked"  
âœ… Liked profiles appear in "You Liked Profiles" tab  
âœ… Notifications are received when someone likes you  
âœ… Mutual matches appear in "Your Matches" tab (Premium)

**Happy matching! ðŸ’•**
